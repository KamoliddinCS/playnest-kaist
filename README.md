## What is PlayNest?

PlayNest is a console-lending platform built **by KAIST students, for KAIST students**. Instead of buying a PS5 or Nintendo Switch that collects dust after exams, just borrow one for a few days and return it when you're done.

No ownership commitment. No storage headaches. No cost barrier.

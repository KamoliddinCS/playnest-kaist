## Without
- Ownership commitment

Use instead: access, booking request, coordination, pickup window, student-managed

## Trust Signals

## Emotional Target
Students should feel: convenient, no need to buy, perfect for after exams, cool someone built this
NOT: commercial business, legally registered, big startup
